# bfast-modis-veg-change
Using BFAST model on MODIS NDVI to investigate vegetation change at the Jornada Experimental Range

I split the code from the original paper (repo https://github.com/gogoprogram/BFAST-Browning-et-al-2017) into two scripts: 

MODIS_JRN_processing.R contains code to obtain and process the most up to date version of MODIS data available

BFAST_MODIS_analysis.R contains code to do the bfast analysis on the processed MODIS data.
